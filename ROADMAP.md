# Hertz RoadMap

From 2025, instead of developing new features we will focus on optimizing core functionalities and user experience.

The following is a list of planned projects.

- [ ] Optimize `RequestContext` issues under concurrency.
- [ ] Refactor binding and validator for better extensibility, and deprecate built-in implementations.
- [ ] Make `netpoll` optional, and `pkg/network/standard` the default.
- [ ] Enhance Content-Encoding extension interface for better extensibility.
- [ ] Optimize `pkg/common/adaptor`, and deprecate implementations with `net/http` alternatives.
- [ ] Deprecate the built-in protobuf code generator, use [cloudwego/prutal](https://github.com/cloudwego/prutal)

All users are encouraged to provide suggestions on the projects listed above, or to submit proposals for enhancing current features.
